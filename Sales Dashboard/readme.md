Utilizing Python for data manipulation, Tableau for visualization, and Excel for additional analysis, I created a comprehensive view of our sales performance:

Data Preparation: I used pandas to load and preprocess the Adidas US Sales 2020-2021 FY dataset from Excel, ensuring it was ready for analysis.

Exploratory Analysis: Identified trends and correlations using seaborn for visualizations like correlation heatmaps, revealing insights into key factors impacting sales.

Trend Analysis: Visualized monthly sales trends using matplotlib, highlighting fluctuations and seasonal patterns in our sales data.

Profit Analysis: Employed pandas to group and analyze operating profits by product, identifying top-performing products crucial for our profitability strategy.

Interactive Visualization: Utilized plotly express to create interactive bar charts, such as regional sales distribution, enabling dynamic exploration of sales data by region.

These tools not only enhanced my technical proficiency across Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel but also deepened my ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets, driving strategic decision-making in real-time.
