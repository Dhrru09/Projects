Utilizing SQL alongside Tableau and Excel, I conducted in-depth customer segmentation analysis:

Customer Metrics: Analyzed customer behavior by aggregating key metrics such as total purchases, total spent, average review ratings, discount usage, previous purchases, and more using SQL queries.

Behavioral Segmentation: Explored demographic insights such as age group preferences, gender-based purchasing behavior, regional variations, and subscription impacts on spending using Tableau visualizations.

Strategic Insights: These analyses facilitated targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences, optimizing sales performance and customer satisfaction.

These tools not only enhanced my proficiency in SQL for data querying and analysis but also deepened my ability to derive actionable insights from complex datasets, crucial for driving business growth.
